# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Terminal-to-Web is a web-based terminal emulator that enables remote control of a macOS terminal from any device through a web browser. The application provides secure terminal access with mobile-optimized interface and real-time communication.

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with WebSocket communication:

### Backend Architecture (Node.js + TypeScript)
- **Server Entry Point**: `src/server.ts` - Express server with Socket.IO integration
- **Terminal Management**: `src/terminalHandler.ts` - Manages PTY processes using node-pty
- **Authentication**: `src/middleware/auth.ts` - JWT-based WebSocket authentication
- **Security**: `src/utils/security.ts` - Rate limiting and IP-based attack prevention
- **Static Files**: Serves frontend from `public/` directory

### Frontend Architecture (Vanilla JS)
- **Terminal Emulation**: Uses xterm.js for browser-based terminal rendering
- **Communication**: Socket.IO client for real-time terminal I/O
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with virtual keyboard and touch controls
- **Quick Commands**: Local storage-based command shortcuts system

### Key Data Flow
1. Client authenticates with password â†’ JWT token issued
2. WebSocket connection established with JWT validation
3. PTY process spawned for authenticated client
4. Bidirectional terminal data flows through Socket.IO events
5. Terminal resize/input events synchronized between client and PTY

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm start           # Run production build
```

### Remote Access Setup
```bash
./setup-cloudflare.sh                    # Configure Cloudflare Tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000  # Quick tunnel
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables (.env)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token signing (CHANGE IN PRODUCTION)
- `ACCESS_PASSWORD` - Authentication password (CHANGE IN PRODUCTION)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)

### Security Considerations
- Default credentials in `.env` must be changed for production use
- Rate limiting: 5 authentication attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- WebSocket authentication required for all terminal operations

## Mobile-Specific Features

The frontend includes extensive mobile optimization:

### Mobile Controls (`public/app.js` - QuickCommands class)
- Virtual control panel with Ctrl/Alt/Tab/Esc buttons
- Arrow key navigation panel
- Quick command shortcuts stored in localStorage
- Responsive font sizing based on device orientation

### Browser Compatibility
- ES5-compatible JavaScript for older mobile browsers
- Fallback CSS with vendor prefixes
- Text-based button labels instead of emoji for universal support

## Key Components

### Terminal Session Management (`src/terminalHandler.ts`)
- One PTY process per WebSocket connection
- Automatic cleanup on client disconnect
- Dynamic terminal resizing support
- Cross-platform shell detection (bash/powershell)

### Authentication Flow (`src/middleware/auth.ts`)
- Password-based initial authentication via REST endpoint
- JWT token stored in client localStorage
- WebSocket connections validated with JWT in handshake
- Per-user session tracking

### Security Implementation (`src/utils/security.ts`)
- In-memory rate limiting (no external dependencies)
- IP-based attempt tracking with automatic cleanup
- Failed attempt logging and progressive lockout

## Remote Access Options

The application supports multiple remote access methods documented in `REMOTE_ACCESS.md`:
1. Cloudflare Tunnel (recommended) - Zero-config public access
2. Ngrok - Simple development tunneling
3. VPS + Nginx - Production deployment with custom domain

Each method requires the server to be running locally and provides HTTPS access from anywhere.
